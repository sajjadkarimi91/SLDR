# SLDR
A MATLAB toolbox for supervised linear dimension reduction (SLDR)


## 1. Introduction.

This package includes the prototype MATLAB codes for supervised linear dimension reduction (LDR).

The implemented methodes include: 

  1- Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA)
  
  2- Heteroscedastic extension of FLDA (HFLDA)  
     Linear dimensionality reduction via a heteroscedastic extension of LDA: the Chernoff criterion
     
  3- Max-min distance analysis (MMDA)  
     Max-min distance analysis by using sequential SDP relaxation for dimension reduction
