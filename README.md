# SLDR
A MATLAB toolbox for supervised linear dimension reduction (SLDR)

Codes for the following papers:

1. Max-min distance analysis by using sequential SDP relaxation for dimension reduction 
2. Linear dimensionality reduction via a heteroscedastic extension of LDA: the Chernoff criterion

## 1. Introduction.

This package includes the prototype MATLAB codes for supervised linear dimension reduction (LDR).

The implemented methodes include: 

  1. Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA)
  2. Heteroscedastic extension of FLDA (HFLDA)       
  3. Max-min distance analysis (MMDA)
