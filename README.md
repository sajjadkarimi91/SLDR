# SLDR
A MATLAB toolbox for supervised linear dimension reduction (SLDR)


1. Introduction.

This package includes the prototype MATLAB codes for supervised linear dimension reduction (LDR).

The implemented methodes include 

  1- Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA)
  
  2- Heteroscedastic extension of FLDA (HFLDA) 
  
  3- Max-min distance analysis (MMDA).
