# SLDR
A MATLAB toolbox for supervised linear dimension reduction (SLDR) including LDA, HLDA, MMDA, WHMMDA, PLS-DA, and SDA

Codes for the following papers were implemented:

1. Heteroscedastic Max–Min distance analysis for dimensionality reduction (WHMMDA)
2. Heteroscedastic max-min distance analysis (WHMMDA)
3. Max-min distance analysis by using sequential SDP relaxation for dimension reduction (MMDA)
4. Linear dimensionality reduction via a heteroscedastic extension of LDA: the Chernoff criterion (HLDA)
5. Multiclass partial least squares discriminant analysis: Taking the right way—A critical tutorial (PLS-DA)
6. Stochastic discriminant analysis for linear supervised dimension reduction (SDA)

## 1. Introduction.

This package includes the prototype MATLAB codes for supervised linear dimension reduction (SLDR).

The implemented methods include: 

  1. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
  2. Heteroscedastic extension of LDA (HLDA)       
  3. Max-min distance analysis (MMDA) 
  4. Heteroscedastic extension of MMDA (WHMMDA) 
  5. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS‐DA) 
  6. Stochastic discriminant analysis (SDA) 
     


## 2. Usage & Dependency.

## Dependency:
     If you want to use MMDA or WHMMDA, you should download the following zip file & extract it in the "cvx-toolbox" or current directory
     CVX MATLAB toolbox for Windows can be downloaded from [website](http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/cvx-w64.zip)

## Usage:
Run and check "demo_run_methods.m" and you'll see the below results for all methods
